A simple series tracker to track all of the series that we watch.


I finally have something that I could put on my own portfolio. A simple series/movie tracker. I no longer have to use my notes app to keep track. The reason I created this project because I'm that type of person that doesn't like to binge a series. I put it on a list and cycle it with many other series. My list ranges from different genres from different years. Would you believe that I have 33 series to watch? Make that 32 because I just finished watching Stranger Things (waiting for season 5)

This app not only helps me keep track of what to watch next, this also informs me when I watched it automatically, and specifically add a comment about. It also has a drag-to-sort feature using SortableJS.

What's working: 
- Add, Edit, Delete function
- SortableJS with correct Index saved to local storage
- Editing a certain list item and placing it on the end of the array

What's not working:
- Responsive design
- Blurring main app when modal container is opened
- Clicking outside to close the modal.

Please do note that this uses your browser's local storage, so the list shown on the screenshot will not be visible on your browser. And lastly, it is not yet mobile friendly üòè .
